<changelog-group category="Fixed">  

    
* Fixed YSOD when accessing transaction info for an order where the Payment Provider no longer existed. Now perform null checks on data ([#58](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/58)).
* Fixed issue with NuGet packages not copying content files on upgrade. Added a powershell script to perform the copy.
* Fixed bug where customer details weren't being persisted into the dedicated fields in the database table (they are still present in the properties collection where they are referenced from 99% of the time) ([#85](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/85)).


</changelog-group>
<changelog-group category="Changed">  

    
* Rule / Reward builders now support infinite editing when creating a rule so closing the editor via the 'close' link now goes back to the rule / reward picker. ([#81](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/81)).


</changelog-group>
<changelog-group category="Removed">  

    
* Removed code for shipping method / payment method picker property editors in favour of the new store entity picker. These were never made public as actual property editors, as they were only used by the rule / reward builder so this won't be classed as a breaking change.

</changelog-group>
<changelog-group category="Fixed">  

    
* Fixed ability to delete orders ([#49](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/49)).
* Fixed issue with orders not finalizing if an error occurs sending emails. Email sending is now wrapped in a try catch that logs errors to the error log instead ([#52](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/52)).
* Fixed bug in EmailTemplateService.SendEmail where it wasn't sending to the supplied To email address unless "Send to Customer" on the email template was checked. This setting now only applies if you call the SendEmail method version that accepts an Order. The signature with the explicit toEmailAddress parameter will always send to the provided email address ([#54](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/54)).
* Percentage reward inputs now only accept decimals ([#59](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/59)).
* Fixed property discount rule, property alias field description describing the wrong thing ([#62](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/62)).


</changelog-group>
<changelog-group category="Changed">  

    
* Changed payment status colours so Authorized is now blue and Refunded is orange so that Refunded doesn't look like an error ([#61](https://github.com/vendrhub/vendr/issues/61)).
