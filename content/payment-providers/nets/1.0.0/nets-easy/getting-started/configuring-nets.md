## API Keys

In order for Vendr to communicate with Nets Easy securely we will need to find the API keys from Nets Easy portal, which will be configured in Umbraco and that Vendr can use to authenticate with. These can be found under **Company > Integration** in Nets Easy portal.

## Webhook 

In order for Nets Easy to notify Vendr of a successful transaction, Nets Easy makes use of webhook technology to directly send notifications of the changing statuses of a transaction. By using webhooks it ensures that the system will always be notified of these status changes, even if the customer decides not to return to the store once a transaction is complete.

Registration of webhook notifications are handles as part of the payment request using the Vendr callback URL as follows (replacing the parameters in curly brackets with the corresponding values taken from your store):

````
https://{store_domain}/umbraco/vendr/payment/callback/nets-easy-checkout/{payment_method_id}/
