## Sign up & Sign in

When working with Klarna, you'll need to sign up for both a live and a developer account.

To sign up for a live account, head on over to the [Klarna site](https://www.klarna.com/) and select to sign up as a seller from their **Klarna for business** menu.

For a developer account, you'll need to go to the [Klarna developer portal](https://developers.klarna.com/documentation/testing-environment/) and select your region to request a developer account.

**NB** Both sign up processes can take a while so be sure to sign up well in advance of going live.

Once you have signed up you'll need to sign in to both of the following portals and follow the remainder of the steps in each portal to get your dev and live credentials.

* **Live** - [https://auth.eu.portal.klarna.com/](https://auth.eu.portal.klarna.com/)
* **Dev** - [https://playground.eu.portal.klarna.com/](https://playground.eu.portal.klarna.com/)
